     the equation i used to calculate altslow assumes that startSpeed and stopSpeed are 0, which, obviously, is not always the case
  
    var mult = (start < stop ? 1 : -1);
    var altslow = start + mult * decel * Math.abs(start - stop) / (decel + accel);
    if(accel != 0 && altslow * mult > slowat * mult){
      console.log(accel);
      console.log(decel);
      //slowat = altslow;
